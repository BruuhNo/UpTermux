# The "print()"
# See an example below:
print("This is an example of print()")

# The output of the above code would be => "This is an example of print()"
# Why?  Because "print()" is used to PRINT / show what is between the parentheses.

# See another example:
print("Hello World!")
# Output => Hello World

# Another example:
print(1+1)
# Output => 2

# Ignore the code below
print("Edit or view this file in an editor to understand...")
